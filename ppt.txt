Three-Year Shift: C-SNP claims jump 120% (5k → 11k), PPO only 18% (7.6k → 9k)-but C-SNP is still the floor. 
- Why? Heavy chronics moved from PPO; PPO emptied, C-SNP filled-no budget explosion, just redistribution. 
- Bottom line: Keep transferring-every PPO patient into C-SNP saves ~$2k/year, keeps ICU from melting.
