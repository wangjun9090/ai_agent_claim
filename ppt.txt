Topic: "Company on Track: C-SNP Takes the Load, PPO/HMO Dries Up."
Update Bullets:

Three-Year Shift: C-SNP soars 120% ($5k → $11k), PPO up 18% ($7.6k → $9k), but C-SNP leads now—proof we’re moving bombs.
Why: Heavy chronics drained from PPO ($9.9k → $9k, -10%) and HMO ($9.2k → $8.9k, -4%) into C-SNP—budget steady, just redistributed.
Next Step: Finish the shift—every PPO/HMO patient to C-SNP saves $2k/year, locks ICU costs down 20%.


Visual: Keep the three bars, add a small arrow from PPO/HMO to C-SNP with "Keep Pushing" text
