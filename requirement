Project Overview: You want to build an automated, AI-driven dashboard for a healthcare project focused on Medicare Advantage plans for seniors (55+ years). The dashboard will analyze historical and daily incoming data to detect outliers, perform cohort analysis, and forecast sales, with Power BI for visualization.
Data Sources:

Membership Table: Demographic info (age, zip code, gender, etc.) and plan data (e.g., HMO, PPO, Medicare Advantage plan history) for seniors, covering 2023–2025.
Claims Table: Raw claim details (member ID, claim amount, procedure codes, place of service like ER/preventive/primary, dates, visit counts) for the same period.
Stored in Databricks, queried via Spark SQL.

Core Requirements:

Outlier Detection:

Automatically detect outliers across all claim categories (e.g., ER spikes, high-dollar claims, frequency bursts, preventive care drops) without predefined categories.
Use three years of historical data (2023–2025, daily granularity) to establish a baseline.
Daily updates: Process new data to flag new outliers (e.g., "County X ER claims up 6x") and generate alerts.
Examples: Sudden claim surges, unusual procedure patterns, or regional anomalies.


Cohort Analysis:

Group data by demographics (age, gender, zip), plan types, and claim patterns (e.g., seniors in Florida on PPO with high preventive claims).
Analyze trends over time (e.g., claim spikes post-plan enrollment, seasonal patterns like winter ER visits).
No predefined cohorts—AI auto-clusters based on data patterns (e.g., high-cost seniors, low-claim snowbirds).


Sales Forecasting:

Forecast sales (plan enrollments) by county, plan type, and demographic cohorts, using claims as predictors (e.g., high preventive claims = sticky sales).
Identify triggers (e.g., HMO enrollment spikes linked to ER claim surges).


Automation:

Fully automated—no manual category setup or babysitting.
AI agent runs daily, processes new data, detects outliers, and updates cohorts.
Outputs (outliers, cohort insights) saved as JSON or tables for Power BI.


Visualization:

Use Power BI for dashboards (20–35+ potential dashboards).
Examples: ER claim spikes by county, preventive care trends by age/plan, outlier alerts, sales forecasts by region.
Integrate via Databricks: Save AI outputs to Delta tables, pull into Power BI via gateway, or embed Python visuals for live updates.



Technical Preferences:

Databricks: Use Spark SQL for simple queries (e.g., flag outliers with standard deviation) or PySpark for advanced ML (e.g., IsolationForest for anomaly detection).
No aggregation: Keep claims at row-level for granular outlier detection.
Scalability: Handle millions of records across hundreds of categories.
